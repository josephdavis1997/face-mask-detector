# face-mask-detector
After the breakout of the worldwide pandemic covid19,there arises several need of protection mechanisms,facemask being the primary one.The basic aim of the project is to detect the presence of a facemask on human face on live streamming video as well as on images.I have used opencv,keras and tensor flow to develop for developingthe face detetector model 

This dataset consists of 1,376 images belonging to two classes
with_mask: 690 images
without_mask: 686 images
Our goal is to train a custom deep learning model to detect whether a person is or is not wearing a mask.
